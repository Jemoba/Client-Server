# Client-Server
Client/Server Course Project for Networking and Communications. 
This project consists of two indepently run files that allow for a connection to be established between two machines or can be run across a single machine.  The server must be running before the client is run.  Once both are running the user will be prompted to login.  This login data will be saved so even if the program is terminated the usernames and passwords will be kept intact.  Upon sucessful login or new user creation, the user will have access to a menu that provides options for file sharing among the client and server.  The file sharing is not limited to certain types of files.  The user will also have access to create directories within the server or the client and place files or the user can change directories to retrieve files.
